# Get5Vue - Front-end website for G5API
_**Status: Under active development.**_

Get5Vue (G5V) is going to be a replacement for the get5-webpanel. _Currently_ this is an implementation for the extent of [G5API](https://github.com/phlexplexico/G5API) and is going to focus on basic features of presenting data.


## Features
- Add teams
- Add seasons/tournaments to track specific stats.
- Add servers to play on.
- Create matches that load on selected servers.
- Control matches with RCON Commands through the match panel.
- Dark mode
- Translations
- Leaderboards
- Individual User Stats

## Issues?
Please report any *match* issues to the [API](https://github.com/phlexplexico/G5API). Display issues, or loading data, please report them here. If it's something to do with the API, the issue will be transferred.

## Why?
[Get5-webpanel](https://github.com/phlexplexico/get5-webpanel) is a now out-dated webpanel, with python2.7 being officially EOL. Being built all on Flask, with ORM (SQLAlchemy), and Jinja2, its tech spans more than a few years old. While it works really well for now, it is becoming increasingly harder to deploy to more modern hardware/software (such as Ubuntu 19) to ensure easy setup.

The intent will to be provide similar functionality with the use of [G5API](https://github.com/phlexplexico/G5API) and Vue (with vuetify!), so it is a more responsive, mobile-friendly website, as opposed to the old one. 

## Building
In order to build this application, I've opted to use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/).

You will also need a working instance of G5API. The setup can be found at that repos [configuration](https://github.com/PhlexPlexico/G5API/wiki/Configuration).

### Build and run development server: 
```yarn serve``` 

Spins up a development server where you can make all your calls, and run it like the current website that is in the sidebar!

### Production: 
```yarn build```

This will generate a minified and buildable version of the website in the `dist` folder to use on a web server. In order to use history, you must have a proxy enabled, and reverse proxy enabled for the API calls. There is some setup involved, depending on your flavour of web servers, but some setup configs can be found [here](https://github.com/PhlexPlexico/G5V/wiki).

### Docker Build Instructions:
There are 2 dockerfiles included, ```DockerfileLight``` and ```DockerfileFull```.

#### DockerfileLight:
This should be used if yarn is already installed on your local machine. 
To use it, you first need to build the application using ```yarn``` and ```yarn build```. This will create a dist folder. 
From here, run the command ```docker build -t yourname\g5v:latest -f DockerfileLight .```
Now, you can run your application by running ```docker container run --name g5v -p 80:80 yourname\g5v:latest```

#### DockerfileFull:
This should be used if you do not have yarn, and do not want to install it. 
This file will install yarn in the container, build the application, and execute it. 
To use it, run ```docker build -t yourname\g5v:latest -f DockerfileFull .```
This can take over a minute to complete.
Now, you can run your application by running ```docker container run --name g5v -p 80:80 yourname\g5v:latest```

G5V requires G5API to be running at `/api`, you can change this behavior run `docker build -t yourname\g5v:latest -f DockerfileFull --build-arg VUE_APP_G5V_API_URL=<your_api_url>` (be sure to include `http(s)://` and not to have a trailing `/`). If you are using Docker Compose refer to [this](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v3/#args).
Some example setup configs can be found [here](https://github.com/PhlexPlexico/G5V/wiki).

## Contribution
Sure! If you have a knack for APIs and a penchant for JavaScript, I could always use help! Create a fork of this application, make your changes, and submit a PR. I will be using the [Issues](https://github.com/G5V/issues) page to track what calls still need to be completed.
